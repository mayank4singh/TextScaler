# TextScaler 📱 (Kotlin + XML)

## 📌 Overview
TextScaler is a simple and interactive Android application developed using **Kotlin and XML**. The app uses a **SeekBar (slider)** to dynamically adjust the **text size in real-time**, demonstrating responsive UI handling and modern Kotlin-based Android development.

This project was built as part of my transition from **Java to Kotlin**, focusing on practical implementation and UI responsiveness.
